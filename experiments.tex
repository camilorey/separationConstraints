\section{Experiments and Results}\label{sec:experiments}

% Hypothesis 
% Backprop limitations due gradient only able to propagate limit the ability of the network to learn when the network grows deep and the 
% the random initialization is not able to preserve the geometry of the dataset, resulting in the problems of dead units/points, which ultimately
% limit the depth on the width or use of other tricks. We remove that dependency and make the depth more independent from width or other tricks

\section{Width vs depth}

% Intro methodology of the experiment: Moons, lr, parameters, epochs, etc...
